# PBinCLI

PBinCLI is a command line client for [PrivateBin](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/) written in Python 3.

# Installation

Installing globally using pip3:
```bash
pip3 install pbincli
```

Installing with `virtualenv`:
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv --python=python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install pbincli
```

*Note*: if you used `virtualenv` installation method, don't forget to activate your virtual environment before running the tool: call `. /path/to/venv/bin/activate` in terminal

# Configuration

By default PBinCLI is configured to use `https://paste.i2pd.xyz/` for sending and receiving pastes. No proxy is used by default.

You can always create a config file to use different settings.

Configuration file is expected to be found in `~/.config/pbincli/pbincli.conf`, `%APPDATA%/pbincli/pbincli.conf` (Windows) and `~/Library/Application Support/pbincli/pbincli.conf` (MacOS)

## Example of config file content

```ini
server=https://paste.i2pd.xyz/
proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

# Usage

PBinCLI tool is started with `pbincli` command. Detailed help on command usage is provided with `-h` option:
```bash
pbincli {send|get|delete} -h
```

## Sending

* Sending text:
```bash
pbincli send -t "Hello! This is a test paste!"
```

* Using stdin input to read text into a paste:
```bash
pbincli send - <<EOF
Hello! This is a test paste!
EOF
```

* Sending a file with text attached into a paste:
```bash
pbincli send -f info.pdf -t "I'm sending my document."
```

* Sending a file only with no text attached:
```bash
pbincli send -q -f info.pdf
```

### Other options

It is also possible to set-up paste parameters such as "burn after reading", expiritaion time, formatting, enabling discussions and changing compression algorithm. Please refer to `pbincli send -h` output for more information.

## Receiving

To retrieve a paste from a server, you need to use `get` command with the paste info.

Paste info must be formated as `pasteID#Passphrase` or just use full URL to a paste. Example:
```bash
pbincli get "xxx#yyy"                        ### receive paste xxx from https://paste.i2pd.xyz/ by default
pbincli get "https://example.com/?xxx#yyy"   ### receive paste xxx from https://example.com/
```

## Deletion

To delete a paste from a server, use `delete` command with paste info:
```bash
pbincli delete "pasteid=xxx&deletetoken=yyy"                        ### delete paste xxx from https://paste.i2pd.xyz/ by default
pbincli delete "https://example.com/?pasteid=xxx&deletetoken=yyy"   ### delete paste xxx from https://example.com/
```

If you need to delete a paste on different server than the configured one, use `-s` option together with the instance URL.

# Additional examples

Here you can find additional examples.

## Usage with I2P enabled services

Change settings to set server to `http://privatebin.i2p/` and proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:4444`. Configuration file for this example is:
```ini
server=http://privatebin.i2p/
proxy=http://127.0.0.1:4444
```

## Using aliases

Example of alias to send a paste from `stdin` direclty to I2P service:
```bash
alias pastei2p="echo 'paste the text to stdin' && pbincli send -s http://privatebin.i2p/ -x http://127.0.0.1:4444 -"
```

Call it by running `pastei2p` in terminal.
